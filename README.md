# Better Better Buffs Bar

**This plugin is currently in Public Beta.** All known bugs have been fixed but there may still be unknown or unencountered bugs. Some buffs may need further threshold adjustments to avoid false positives / false negatives. Sometimes those thresholds aren't impossible to make 100% reliable (eg. Quiver) so are not considered bugged.

This is a from-the-ground rewrite of the old Better Buffs Bars. The performance has been improved by over 800%, features are less buggy, it shouldn't make you lag anymore, it won't be delayed if you try and track more than 6-7 buffs at a time. You can have as many buff bars as you like and optional audio alerts will let you know when certain, upkeepable buffs are falling off or if you're running low on prayer.

It's better in pretty much every measurable way - except that the app no longer blends in with the NIS interface. That is something I plan to support but it is low priority.

Enjoy.


## How to Install & Required Settings

To install Better Buff Bar copy & paste this link into Alt1's browser app:
`alt1://addapp/https://nadyanayme.github.io/better-better-buffs-bars/appconfig.json`

If you do not have Alt1 Toolkit installed already you can [download it from runeapps.org](https://runeapps.org/alt1). In order for Better Buff Bar to work make sure your Runescape settings for buff bar size is set to `small` and that your Game and UI Scale settings are set to `100%` as these settings are required for Alt1 to be able to read your game screen.

**Currently only works with Small Buff icons**. Alt1's BuffReader only works with small buff icons so this is unlikely to change soon.
