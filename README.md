# Better Better Buffs Bar

**This plugin is currently in BETA. Some features may not exist, were removed, or are broken.** 

Track only the buffs that actually matter.


## How to Install & Required Settings

To install Better Buff Bar copy & paste this link into Alt1's browser app:
`alt1://addapp/https://nadyanayme.github.io/better-better-buffs-bars/dist/appconfig.json`

If you do not have Alt1 Toolkit installed already you can [download it from runeapps.org](https://runeapps.org/alt1). In order for Better Buff Bar to work make sure your Runescape settings for buff bar size is set to `small` and that your Game and UI Scale settings are set to `100%` as these settings are required for Alt1 to be able to read your game screen.

**Currently only works with Small Buff icons**. Alt1's BuffReader only works with small buff icons so this is unlikely to change soon.
